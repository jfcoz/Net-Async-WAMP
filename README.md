Net::Async::WAMP
================

### About

**Net::Async::WAMP** is a Perl implementation of the [WebSocket Application
Messaging Protocol][1].

### Building from GitHub Source

The **Net::Async::WAMP** distribution is managed by [**Dist::Zilla**][2]. Many
of the files necessary to build this module are not included in the GitHub
repository since they are built by **Dist::Zilla**. If you'd like to build
**Net::Async::WAMP** from the source code available on GitHub, you'll first
need to grab the author dependencies (assuming you've got [**dzil**][3] and
[**cpanm**][4] installed):

    $ dzil authordeps | cpanm

After that, you can build **Net::Async::WAMP** via:

    $ dzil build

You can then test the distribution via:

    $ dzil test
