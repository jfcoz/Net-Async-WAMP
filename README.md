Net::Async::WAMP
================

### About

**Net::Async::WAMP** is a Perl implementation of the [WebSocket Application
Messaging Protocol][1]. It's currently in pre-alpha development and as such is
only available from GitHub. Once there's a somewhat usable implementation I
plan on publishing an alpha release on [CPAN][2].

The implementation of **Net::Async::WAMP** will likely rely on [Paul Evan][3]'s
[**Net::Async::WebSocket**][4] module to provide the WebSockets transport layer
and [**Future**][5] module to provide a RPC function calling mechanism.

### Building from GitHub Source

The **Net::Async::WAMP** distribution is managed by [**Dist::Zilla**][6]. Many
of the files necessary to build this module are not included in the GitHub
repository since they are built by **Dist::Zilla**. If you'd like to build
**Net::Async::WAMP** from the source code available on GitHub, you'll first
need to grab the author dependencies (assuming you've got [**dzil**][7] and
[**cpanm**][8] installed):

    $ dzil authordeps | cpanm

After that, you can build **Net::Async::WAMP** via:

    $ dzil build

You can also test the distribution via:

    $ dzil test

### Additional Tests

Code coverage metrics are available using
[**Dist::Zilla::App::Command::cover**][9]. Just run:

    $ dzil cover

Once `dzil cover` has been run, you will find a **cover_db** folder containing
the code coverage metrics in the temporary module build directory (e.g.
**.build/2OXAYzqh1_/cover_db**).
